# risc-As
## A simple RISC-V assembler written in Rust. 
It takes an assembly file as input, parses the instructions and labels, and outputs a binary file containing the machine code.

### Features ‚ú®
#### RISC-V Instruction Support: 
Assembles a subset of RISC-V RV32I instructions, including:

- R-Type: `add, sub, sll, slt, sltu, xor, srl, sra, or, and`
- I-Type: `addi, slti, sltiu, xori, ori, andi, slli, srli, srai`
- S-Type: `sb, sh, sw`
- B-Type: `beq, bne, blt, bge, bltu, bgeu`
- U-Type: `lui, auipc`
- J-Type: `jal`

#### Label Resolution:
Supports labels for branches and jumps, automatically calculating offsets.

#### Register Parsing:
Handles both ABI names (e.g., ra, sp, t0) and numerical x registers (e.g., x1, x2).

#### Binary Output:
Generates a .bin file containing the assembled machine code.

### How to Use üöÄ
#### Prerequisites
Rust: Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. If not, you can install it from rust-lang.org.

#### Building the Assembler
Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pranav-avn/riscAs
cd riscAs
```

Build the project:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

This will create an executable in the target/release/ directory.

#### Running the Assembler
To assemble an assembly file, run the compiled executable with the input assembly file and the desired output file name:

```shell
./target/release/riscv_assembler <input_assembly_file.asm> <output_binary_file_name>
```

#### Example:

Let's say you have an assembly file named example.asm:

```asm
# test risc-v assembly file
.main:
    addi t0, zero, 1      # initialize t0 to 1
    addi s0, zero, 0      # result (s0) = 0
    addi t1, zero, 10     # loop end value
.loop:
    add s0, s0, t0        # add to the result
    addi t0, t0, 1        # increment the counter
    bge t1, t0, .loop    # loop condition
```

To assemble it into program.bin, you would run:

```shell
./target/release/riscv_assembler example.asm program
```

This will generate a file named program.bin in the current directory.

### Project Structure üìÅ
##### main.rs:
The entry point of the assembler, handling file I/O and orchestrating the parsing process.

##### parse.rs:
Contains the core logic for parsing assembly instructions, encoding them into machine code, and resolving labels.
